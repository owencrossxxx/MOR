# 6-legged Robot

## Presentation

**Brief description :**

This robot has 6 legs actuated independently by 6 motors, which allows it to have various kind of movements.

**Why reduce it :**

To show that we can easily reduce parts of a soft robot and re-use it in the full robot.
Here we only reduce the leg of our robot not its core. 

## Reduction Parameters

To make a reduced model of one leg of this robot, we had to create a new special function to explore its workspace.
To create the rotation mouvement we see on the different previous videos we rotate a point that will be followed by the model creating the rotation.

[here](../../../_autosummary/_autosummary/mor.animation.defaultShaking.html) how it was implemented

We have only one actuator here, so our *listObjToAnimate* contains only one object:

	ObjToAnimate("actuator","shakingSofia",'MechanicalObject',incr=0.05,incrPeriod=3,rangeOfAction=6.4,dataToWorkOn="position",angle=0,rodRadius=0.7)

With these different parameters we will after perform the reduction like explained [here](../../tutorial/modelOrderReduction.html#reduction-process-tutoriel)
